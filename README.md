## Question To Be Answered
Given movie review datasets that includes names, length, rating, etc., can we create a chatbot that processes user requests for movie recommendations based on user requirements such as certain years (can be a range), length (can be a range), rating (can be a range), genre, etc.?

"Suggest an action movie made between 2018-2019 that has a rating of 8.0 or greater."

* Build chatbot app to collect user input
** Parse/tokenize input

** Formulate movie suggestion response, recommend movie(s)

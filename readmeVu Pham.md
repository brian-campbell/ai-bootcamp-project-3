## Movie Recommender Bot with LangChain and TMDb

    This project is a conversational movie recommendation bot powered by LangChain and OpenAIâ€™s language model. Users can receive tailored movie suggestions based on genre, release year, ratings, and runtime using The Movie Database (TMDb) API. The bot is hosted on a Gradio interface for a seamless interactive experience.

### Features

* Conversational Interaction: Users can chat naturally, specifying preferences like genre, release years, and rating levels.

* Detailed Movie Information: Provides additional movie details, including release date, rating, and runtime.

* Dynamic Querying: Determines user needs from text input to fetch relevant movie recommendations from TMDb.

### Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Dependencies:
* langchai
* openai
* requests
* gradio

Install dependencies with:

    pip install langchain openai requests gradio

## Setup

    API Keys:

        Obtain your OpenAI API Key from OpenAI.
        Obtain your TMDb API Key from The Movie Database.

Configure API Keys: Replace the placeholder keys in the code with your own OpenAI and TMDb keys:

    openai_api_key = "your_openai_api_key"
    tmdb_api_key = "your_tmdb_api_key"

## Usage

### Running the Bot

1)   Start the Gradio interface:

            chatgpt_interface.launch()

2) Example Queries:

* "Suggest some recent action movies."

* "Can you find highly rated dramas from 2020 to 2023?"

* "Recommend top-rated sci-fi movies under 120 minutes."

3) Explanation of Main Functions:

* query_tmdb: Interacts with the TMDb API to retrieve movie recommendations based on user preferences.

* chatgpt_direct_movie_recommender: Processes user input, detects relevant keywords (e.g., genre, year, rating), and queries TMDb if necessary.

## Technical Overview

* LangChain and Prompting:

    * A custom PromptTemplate is used to guide the conversation.

    * ConversationBufferMemory stores chat history, allowing for continuity in responses.
    
* API Querying:

    * query_tmdb fetches movie data from TMDb, filtering by genre, year, and rating based on user input.
    
    * The bot limits responses to the top 10 results for optimal performance.
